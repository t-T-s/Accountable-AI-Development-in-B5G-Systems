# 📡 Accountable AI Development in B5G Systems

This repository contains the code, data, and metric computation framework introduced in the thesis chapter *"Accountable AI Development in B5G Systems"*. The work focuses on quantifying and enforcing explainability, fairness, and transparency in AI models deployed within next-generation (5G and B5G) intelligent networking systems.

## 🔍 Features

- 📊 **Explainability Metrics**: Implementation of custom post-hoc explainability metrics (e.g., fidelity, comprehensibility, contrastiveness) based on SHAP, LIME, and TreeSHAP.
- 🧠 **Model-Agnostic Framework**: Compatible with both classical ML models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) and deep learning models used in wireless systems (e.g., MLP, LSTM).
- 🛰️ **Use Case Integration**: Supports simulations for Encrypter Network Traffic Analysis.
- 🔄 **Closed-Loop Feedback**: Prototype for integrating external stakeholder feedback into AI system updates.
- 📉 **Visualization Tools**: Jupyter notebooks for visualizing explanations and metric trends across time and use cases.
